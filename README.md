# Klothsy

Klothsy is an Online Ecommerce Shopping Application.

Proposed System

The aim of this project i.e. Online Mall Shopping is to advertise the products(i.e. Clothes, Shoes, and basic regular wear items for MEN,WOMEN) for sale.  
There is only one type of user in this system, known as registered user. The user can buy the products such as Clothes, Shoes, and basic regular items. 
The user can only purchase the products by selecting them after login. The user has to first create his/her account to become the registered user. 
The user can also see his/her purchase of the product.


The proposed system has following advantages over the existing system:

●	Admin login: admin can login through phpmyadmin and make any appropriate changes to the website.

●	User registration and login: any new customer can register following which he/she will be provided with an unique user id and password through which user will be able to login.

●	Online shopping: the user can access hundreds of products available on the website and can buy them through the web application making any user on the earth to have access to the products.

●	Product tracking: the users can track the product status on the web application in couple of minutes instead of calling the customer support.

●	Online payment: the website provides a safe and secure payment gateway to make payments for all of the purchases.
